# PongSolo
(Work in Progress) PongSolo is my first attempt to build a game engine.

The TODO list file (/Pong/TODO.txt) may not be updated, and is merely ment to keep notes.

[Important] Everything inside the Pong/src/Rendering/Model folder is from an older project. All the code in that folder is quite confused
and i will soon reengineer all of it.

[Important] The main function is, at the moment, only a demo to test if the project is working correctly, as well as all the Prefab classes in the same file.

If you're interested in this project or have any suggestion feel free to drop me an email at: alessandro.ravaglia6@gmail.com

Thank you for taking the time to read this file.
